Hello again SkillBase friends.
Well, I was seriously JUST going to implement the RAG agent and call it a day, but then I noticed that a lot of my functions were yelling at me because they were too complex. So, I went down the rabbit hole of modularization. I just finished up breaking down the RAG agent into more modular components, and it was quite a task.
I was so focused on just getting something running that I didnt really think about the implications of my actions. I had to take a step back and reassess my approach. So, now I am going to develop this with a more component based modular mindset. I will start by breaking down the RAG agent into smaller components, each responsible for a specific task. This will make it easier to test and maintain the code. Additionally, I will use a component-based architecture to ensure that each component is loosely coupled and can be easily replaced or extended. This will make it easier to add new features or fix bugs in the future.

## Improvements
1. Modularized the RAG agent into smaller components.
2. Implemented a component-based architecture.
3. Improved code readability and maintainability.
